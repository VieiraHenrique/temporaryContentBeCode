### Conditionals

---

Woooww... that was a nightmare !

But once you grasped the ins and outs of Booleans, Comparison and Logical operators, you are ready to do some very fun stuff in JavaScript !

Now, we are going to see conditionals and implement logic into our code ! Uhuuu !!!!

A conditional syntax in JavaScript is given as follow :

```js
if (boolean) {
  // run this code
} else if (boolean) {
  // run this code
} else {
  // run this code
}
```

Pretty explanatory isn't it ?
So... Let's see if I can enter a bar that sells alcohol.

```js
const name = "Henrique";

let age = 35;

if (age < 18) {
  alert(`Hey ${name}, sorry... you are too young to enter the bar`);
} else if (age > 80) {
  alert(`Come on ${name} ! You are too old ! Get back to sleep !`);
} else {
  alert(`Hey there ${name} ! Enter and make yourself confortable`);
}
```

Can make sense of what is going on here ? In plain english :

If I am under 18, I cannot enter the bar. If I am over 80, apparently, I am too old to be there. Otherwise, I can enter !

And for each possibility the browser will send a different message !

That's just beautiful, isn't it ?!
