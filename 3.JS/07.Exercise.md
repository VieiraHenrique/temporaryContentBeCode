## Exercise : Variables, Strings and Numbers

---

Little example :

Let's say you have a website where you want to display the name of a city, the weather condition and the temperature. We will have to have four variables.

Test this out in your machine :

```js
const city = "Brussels";

let weatherCondition = "rainy";

let temperature = 24.16879;

const weatherText = `The weather in ${city} is ${weatherCondition} and it's ${parseInteger(
  temperature
)}°C outside`;

console.log(weatherText); // Prints : The weather in Brussels is rainy and it's 24°C outside.
```

---

Now let me present you a new command...

You already saw `alert()` that creates a popup with a message.
Did you know there is also `prompt()` ? It creates a popup as well but asks you to give an answer. This answer is what is returned by this operation.

Try for yourself :

```js
prompt("What is your name?");
```

You can now answer.

Ok... but where is your response ?

The response is returned but we didn't capture it anywhere. Why don't we use a variable to do it ?

Try :

```js
const name = prompt("What is your name?");

alert(`Welcome ${name}!`);
```

Now, do this :

- Ask your user what is his name.
- Ask your user how old is he.
- Ask your user where does he live.
- Alert a message greeting the user and telling him how old he is and where he lives.
