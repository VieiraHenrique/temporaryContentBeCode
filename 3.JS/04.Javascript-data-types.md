# Javascript Data Types

---

Ok, we saw that in JavaScript we work with values as data. But what sort of data there is ? That's what we call `data types`. The types of data Javascript can handle, understand and manipulate.

Before we continue, here is an operator we can use : `typeof`
It will return de type of the value/variable you put between parenthesis.

```js
let num1 = 57;

console.log(typeof num1);
```

Result : `number`

```js
let name = "Henrique";

console.log(typeof name);
```

Result : `string`

The primiteva data types we have in JavaScripts are :

- Strings
- Numbers
- Arrays (not actually a primitive because it's actually an object, but don't worry about this for now)
- Objects
- Booleans
- Null / Undefined

Ok... there are two more, but we only use them after years and years of experience. Let's not complicate ;)
