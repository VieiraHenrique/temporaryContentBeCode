### Javascript Strings Exercise

---

Let's get some practice working with string methods.

Without altering the original value stored in `message`, please define a variable called `whisper` that is a lowercased version of `message`, with all the extra space at the beginning and end removed. You will need to use two string methods that we just covered.

Bonus: Make it in one line !

Copy this code :

```js
// DON'T TOUCH THIS LINE!
const message = "    TASTE THE RAINBOW!  "; //DON'T CHANGE THIS LINE PLEASE!

// YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:
```

---

Another one :

Write a code that log to the console the last character of a string.

Tips :

- Play with index selection and length

I've provided you with a `word` variable, set to "skateboard". Your goal is to use string methods on `word`, so that you end up with the string "beard".

Use a string method to extract the "board" part of "skateboard" (using the slice method)

Replace the "o" in board with an "e" (using the replace method)

Save the result in a variable called facialHair

```js
// DON'T TOUCH THIS LINE! (please)
const word = "skateboard"; //Don't change this line!

// YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:
```
