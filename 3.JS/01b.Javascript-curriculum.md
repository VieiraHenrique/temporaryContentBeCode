We are going to deep dive into the wonderful world of JavaScript. Here below you can find a list of the topics we will study.

The strategy here is to arrive as soon as possible at the end of each module, and then come back for a second layer of understanding with some more complex content.

### What we will see :

- Variables
- Data types

  - Numbers
    - operators
    - the Math object
  - Strings

    - property (length)
    - methods

  - Booleans
  - Null and Undefined
  - Arrays
    - methods
  - Objects

- Conditionals
