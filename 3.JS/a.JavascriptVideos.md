About videos...

There is this very nice [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7TLF4T4Tq2TtNmadzRfxYIB9683uhpbD) with a very solid course on JavaScript. The only problem is that it takes aproximatively 8 hours to follow it from start to end. So don't hesitate to cherry pick the videos you want about what you want.

Want a REALLY good introduction to JS ? Follow [this 1h40 crash course](https://youtu.be/hdI2bqOjy3c?si=w5UpTKCs3yQcgxV9) from Brad Traversy.

Try to only watch the parts you just ended reading and doing exercises.
