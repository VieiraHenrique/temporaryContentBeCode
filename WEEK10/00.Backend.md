Today, we are going to start working on the backend side of Web Development ! Yay !!!!

Sooner in the course, we've discussed about how the internet works, the request-response cycle in the server-client relationship and the roles of the backend.

Let's catch up !

When we talk about a web application, we're talking about code that runs in two sides :

- the client (inside the browser) and;
- the server (a computer set up to serve and interact with the client through requests and responses)

Until now, all of our code ran inside the browser. Indeed, the browser (Google Chrome for example) has an engine built-in to it that reads and executes our javascript code.

The browser also "reads" (interpret) html and css code in order to display them.

Everything happens in the browser !

But some **computer** must **be able** to **receive requests** for these html/css/js files !

This computer must know what response to send in the various different scenarios we could encounter.

Here is a veeeery concise list of things a backend might be asked to handle :

- if I receive a GET request to the root endpoint (`/`), what should I respond with ? (some files ? an error message ? some json ?)

- if I receive a GET request to this enpoint : `/about`, what should I respond with ?

- If I receive a request to my `/myBasket` (in case of an ecommerce for example), I should respond with the items that are in the basket. But for which user ? Is the user connected ?

- If I receive a request to `/login` with some data in the Headers in order to login. With what should I respond ?
