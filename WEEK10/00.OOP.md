Today, we are gonna start to study OOP !

**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming

OOP is a programming approach that focuses on objects and their interactions rather than functions and algorithms. It allows real concepts to be represented in source code using classes, objects and methods.

Well... not that easy to get, is it ?

Let's try to understand...

We could say there are two/three main programming paradigms : `functional` and `object oriented`.

A programming paradigma is a "**way of doing stuff** when programming". The way we approach our code.

Until now, we've been programming on JavaScript in the `procedural`/`functional` way of doing it. That means :

**Procedural**

Writing sequential series of executions steps/tasks.
