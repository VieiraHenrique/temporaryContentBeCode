Today, we are gonna start to study OOP !

**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming

_OOP is a programming approach that focuses on objects and their interactions rather than procedural code with functions all over the place. It allows real concepts to be represented in source code using classes, objects and methods._

Well... not that easy to get, is it ?

Let's try to understand...

We could say there are three main programming paradigms : `procedural`, `functional` and `object oriented`.

A programming paradigm is a "**way of doing stuff** when programming". The way we approach our code.

Until now, we've been programming on JavaScript in the `procedural`/`functional` way of doing it. This means :

**Procedural**

- Writing sequential series of executions steps/tasks.

- Top to bottom code execution. Every time we need something we create it sequentially and run it.

**Functional**

- Organize code in (pure) functions with clearly defined tasks.

- Pass data around via parameters.

**OOP**

- Organize data and logic within objects (properties + methods)

- Organize code in logical entities
