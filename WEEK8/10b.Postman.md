# Postman

---

Ok... You may have heard about it, but when you enter an url with your browser, you're doing a `GET` request.

When we talk about APIs we'll see there are several request methods we can (and will) use.

Not all APIs (actually a small part of them) can be accessed directly by calling its endpoint.

That's why we are going to install a software called `Postman`

With Postman, we can make several requests without having to code our request.

Download it [here](https://www.postman.com/) (you'll have to register. It's free !)

Create a workspace and add a new request with the PLUS (`+`) button
