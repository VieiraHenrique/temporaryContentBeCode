### JavaScripts For loops

---

For loops are one of the most common loop types.

For someone that never saw anything like that, the syntax can be a liiiitle bit intimidating and not very intuitive. But buckle up : it's not hard.

The syntax is somethin like that :

```

for (
    [initialExpression];
    [condition]
    [incrementExpression]
)

```

So let me show an example :

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

![Alt text](image.png)

This for loop will print in the console all the numbers from 1 to 10.

What we can see is that we are creating a new variable that lives inside of the loop. This variable doesn't do anything outside of the code of the loop. (That's an introduction of the concept of `scope`: It lives in the scope of the loop)

Let's try to understand this code :

We declare `let i = 1`
So it starts with 1 and then it looks at the condition :
`i<=10`.

Does it satisfy the condition ? Yes. 1 is less or equal than 10.

So, it runs the code inside of the loop `console.log(i)`

Then, when all the code inside the loop has ran, it performs the increment expression, which is `add 1 to i`.

So `i` now is 2. Does it satisfy the condition (less or equal to 10) ? Yes. So it runs de code inside the loop one more time.

Than it adds 1 to `i` again...

Etc, etc... Untill `i` becomes 10. Does it still satisfy the condition ? Yes. It's equal to 10. So it runs the code.

But then, it goes to the increment expression and `i` becomes 11. So we check if 11 is less or equal then 10 and it's not.

So the loop is over and the code inside the loop doesn't run anymore.

For all the following exercises, the code inside the loop must only be `console.log(i)`

#### Our first For Loop practice

Please use a for loop to print out the classic chorus lyrics of "I'm Blue" by Eiffel 65. Use a for loop to print out the string "Da ba dee da ba daa" exactly 6 times. No more, and no less.

#### Even numbers

Let's try another thing... Write a code that will log to the console only the even numbers untill 20.

The goal here is to see that the increment expression doesn't have to be necessarely `i++`

Attention : the 0 should no be counted.

The result in your console should be :

`2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
`

Now, do the same thing for odd numbers untille 20.

The result in your console should be :

`1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19
`

#### Decrement

Let's inverse a little bit the logic.

Let's print all the multiple of 10 from 100 to 1;

The result in your console should be :

`100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10`

And now do another one that should print :

`25 20 15 10 5 0`

#### Another one

Let's do something else...
How could I have this result on my console :

`10 100 1000`

# Infinite loops

Be careful with loops !

May be you already had it, but you can easily get into the dark world of infinite loop !

That means : somehow, the condition statement in the loop never get false and so the loop doesn't end.

This will lead your browser to crash. Quicly close it !!!

Example :

```js
for (let i = 1; i >= 0; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

See the problem here ?

`i` starts at 1 and is bigger than 0 so it increments by 1.
Now `i` equals to 2, then 3, then 4 and it nevers get equals to 0 (and it never will)

So after a second, `i` will be... I don't know.. at `462137654132168796432168241984574321645742` and it will keep running untill your browser crashes !

So be carefull ! Before running a loop, always ask yourself if the condition will get to be `false` at some point.

# Looping over arrays

I told you that looping over arrays are essential to extract data in order to perform all kinds of operations with it.

Have an idea on how to over through an array with the for loop ?

Well... remember how we can access an element in an array...

```js
const colors = ["blue", "red", "violet", "yellow"];

// If I want to access "violet", what should I do ?

// Ok... you already know it :

colors[2]; // !!!!
```

So how could I loop through an array ?

Look at the indexes.. they go from 0 to 3.

That means I could loop with a value `i` that goes from 0 to 3.

If the length of my array is 4 (always one number more than its last index), I could do :

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= colors.length - 1; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i]);
}
```

or :

```js
for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i]);
}
```

It's the same thing. Do you get why ?
If not, ask a colleague. ;)

#### Little exercise

Let's create a for loop that log to the console all the items from an array but backwards.

```js
const animals = ["lion", "pangolim", "zebra", "dog", "cat", "bird"];
```

So, the console shoud print :

`"bird" "cat" "dog" "zebra" "pangolim" "lion"`

---

#### Another one

Copy this array of objects in your code :

```js
const users = [
  {
    fistName: "Vito",
    lastName: "Corleone",
  },
  {
    fistName: "William",
    lastName: "Wallace",
  },
  {
    fistName: "Harry",
    lastName: "Potter",
  },
  {
    fistName: "Amadeus",
    lastName: "Mozart",
  },
  {
    fistName: "Barack",
    lastName: "Obama",
  },
];
```

Use a loop to log to your console a ordered list of these persons's fullname. The result should be :

```js

1. My full name is Vito Corleone.
2. My full name is William Wallace.
3. My full name is Harry Potter.
4. My full name is Amadeus Mozart.
5. My full name is Barack Obama.

```

Don't forget the numbers (and it starts at 1)

#Nested loops

**Ok, great ! Now you are a master of the For Loop !**

I hope you didn't get too much infinite loops and spared your machine. :P

You'll see later that there are many array methods that automatically loop through an array, and we don't have to use a For Loop every time. But for now, that's awesome !
