## Exercise : Ransom note

---

Write a function called `ransomNote` which takes two parameters : `noteText` and `magazineText`.

The goal is : with all the words of `magazineText`, you should be able to create the `noteText`.

The function should return `true` if we are able to write the `noteText` with the words from `magazineText` or `false` if we can't.

#### Notes

Here are two examples :

```
noteText = "this is a secret note for you for a secret admirer"
```

```
magazineText = "puerto rico is a great place you must hike far from town to find a secret waterfall that i am an admirer of but note that it is not as hard as it seems this is my advice to you"
```

In the case above, it would work

#### Expected results
