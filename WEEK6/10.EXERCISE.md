#### Exercise 4

Let's do something a little bit more complex.

We are going to create a "score keeper".

Let's say you are playing ping-pong with your friend and you are playing "best of 5". That means : after 5 matches, the one that won the most matches wins the game.

You want to create a program that counts how many matches `player 1` wins and how many matches `player 2` wins.

We will do this trough buttons.

There is a button for each player that increments the score. The score is then displayed.

When we arrive at 5 total matches, the buttons are disabled (we can't click them anymore). And the score of the winner becomes green and the color of the loser becomes red.

Then, you can click on a button `reset` to start all over again.
