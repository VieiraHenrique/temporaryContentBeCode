# Final exercise. (for now...)

---

We've been there... take this [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BOQeWAOcK6yghLoAYEYp6p/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev) and reproduce it as close as possible.

Read the comments for instructions on how things should behave.
Implement AOS animations in the elements you want.

Good luck !
